Driving Licence Detection Streamlit Web App Documentation

Overview

The Driving Licence Streamlit Web App is designed to facilitate the detection of Driving Licence in uploaded images. This document provides an overview of the app, its functionalities, advantages, disadvantages, limitations, and other relevant information.

General Information

The Driving Licence Detection Streamlit Web App is powered by a deep learning model trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model leverages the TensorFlow and Keras libraries for deep learning implementation.

Functionalities
1. Image Upload
Users can upload images in common formats such as JPG, JPEG, and PNG.

2. Driving Licence Detection
The app incorporates Driving Licence detection logic based on a deep learning model to determine the existence of Driving Licence in the provided images.

Accepted File Formats
The web app accepts images in the following formats:

1.JPG
2.JPEG
3.PNG

Advantages

1.User-Friendly Interface:
The Streamlit app provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to upload images and receive Driving Licence detection results.

2.Driving Licence Detection:
Specialized in detecting Aadhaar cards, offering a focused solution for users with Aadhaar-related needs.

Disadvantages

1.Limited to Driving Licence:
The app is designed specifically for detecting Driving Licence and may not be suitable for identifying other types of cards.

Limitations

1.Accuracy:
The accuracy of Driving Licence detection relies on the underlying CNN model. Improvements in accuracy may require further refinement of detection algorithms.

2.Dependency on External Models:
The app relies on pre-trained models for Driving Licence detection using TensorFlow Keras. Regular updates to these models may be necessary for improved performance.

Future Enhancements

1.Model Training:
Consider retraining the Driving Licence detection model with a larger and more diverse dataset to enhance accuracy.

2.User Feedback:
Implement a user feedback mechanism to collect input for further Aadhaar card detection model improvement.
